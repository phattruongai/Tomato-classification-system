## 1. Core classification model (Convolutional neural network combined with Grad-CAM visualization):

* [Classification](Classification)

## 2. PCB and circuit diagram:

* [PCB](PCB)

## 3. Code for controller (STM32F103C8T6):

* [Controller-STM32F1](Controller-STM32F1)


## I also have an IEEE paper for this project which represented at [GTSD 2020](https://easychair.org/cfp/GTSD2020)
